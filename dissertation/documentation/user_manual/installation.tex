\section*{Installation}

\subsection*{System Requirements}
The system has been designed and tested on a portable computing system, and thus should operate effectively on a modern laptop. The minimum recommended requirements are as follows: \\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating System: Microsoft Windows 7
    \item Processor: 1.5GHz Dual-core x86/x64
    \item Memory: 4GB
    \item Hard Drive: 20GB free
    \item USB Drive/Internet Connectivity/CD Drive (for installation)
    \item Xbox Kinect / Microsoft Kinect device
\end{itemize} \\

\subsection*{Kinect}
The majority of the functionality requires that an Xbox Kinect is installed and present on the system. This requires the installation of the Kinect for Windows drivers, which should occur automatically once the device has been plugged in for the first time. 

\subsection*{Software}
The software can be installed by dragging and dropping the contents from the installation media into a suitable directory on the computer where the software is intended to be deployed. %or packaging it up in the form of an installer, vs2010 supports this? bernie

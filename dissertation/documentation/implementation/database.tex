\subsection{Database}
For the storage requirements of the toolkit, a database has been put in place and it is used to store the details of the patients and their scans and measurements. To assist in the storage and retrieval of information from the database a specific class has been designed, that includes all the required queries. All accesses to the database are done in a clean and efficient way by using parameterised queries (otherwise called prepared statements). This not only enables re-usability of queries for different tables and sets of data but also makes the usage of the database safer as they provide protection against SQL injection attacks. \\

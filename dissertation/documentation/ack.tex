The members of PARSE would like to express their most sincere gratitude to a number of individuals whose contributions made this project possible.\\ 

Firstly, we would like to thank Dr. Abhir Bhalerao, our project supervisor, for the support he gave to the group as a whole and to individuals throughout the course of this project. Next, we would like to thank our second assessor and good friend Dr. Matt Leeke, who generously provided us with his time for advice, support, and guidance, in addition to acting as project customer. We also extend thanks to our moderator Prof. Artur Czumaj for his time and to Dr. Sara Kalvala for allowing us the permanent use of an iLab Kinect over the duration of the project. Thanks also go to Dr. Paul Summers of the European Institute of Oncology and Prof. Massimo Pelligrini of the Clinical and Public Health University of Italy for suggesting the initial idea.\\

Finally, we would like to thank the various people who were scanned during the testing phase of the project. Their biometric data has proven invaluable.\\
